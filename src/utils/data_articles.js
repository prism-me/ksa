    <p>The rosy picture shown on baby websites of a baby happily drinking milk off the bottle is very misleading for new parents. In reality, identifying the right baby bottles that suit your baby’s needs and figuring out the best way to feed the baby can be a very frustrating process. Whether the baby is breastfed or drinking formula milk, here are a few things to look out for.</p>
    <h6>The Feeding Bottle</h6>
                  <p>It is best to wait till after the baby is born before you set out to buy a baby bottle. Till about 6 months of age, babies should be feeding only on breastmilk or infant formula. Choose wide necked milk bottles that are easy to take apart and clean during those months. Irrespective of whether the bottles are made of glass or plastic, check to ensure that only bpa free baby bottles make their way to your baby. Also pay close attention to the type of nipple that is being used. PIGEON Nursing Bottle with SofTouch™ Peristaltic PLUS Nipple or Peristaltic Nipple has been designed to help the baby to feed naturally and has an Air Ventilation System (AVS™) that helps to adjust the air pressure inside the bottle. The specially designed projections at the base and the top of the nipple allows milk to flow smoothly into the baby’s mouth.</p>
                  <p>How you prepare the baby’s feeding bottle and the way the milk is fed to the baby are also important factors that new parents should keep in mind.</p>
                  <h6>Preparing the Baby Bottle</h6>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Always sterilize the baby milk bottle and other baby feeding accessories before using them for the first time. After the first use, they can be sterilized once a week or more often, depending on the frequency of use.</li>
                  <li>Whether feeding on breastmilk or baby formula, ensure that the feed is at approximately the temperature of the mother’s skin. When warming up a cold bottle, warm them in a bowl of hot water or in a bottle warmer. Using a microwave can create hot spots that can burn the baby’s mouth.</li>
                  <li>Before feeding the baby, check the temperature of the milk by swirling it in the bottle and then testing a few drops on the inside of your wrist.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h6>Getting the Baby to Accept the Bottle</h6>
                  <p>Since sucking is an instinctive reflex, some babies tend to take to a bottle very easily. Other babies, however, have a really hard time adapting to a feeding bottle especially if they are used to being breastfed. The difference in sucking when switching to a bottle can put some babies off as they miss the comfort of breastfeeding. After years of in-depth study of babies’ sucking science, PIGEON has designed SofTouch™ Peristaltic PLUS Nipple to help initiate a tongue and jaw movement that is natural and comfortable for babies.</p>
                  <p>The following tips may help your baby to adjust to the milk bottle easily:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <p><strong>Do not offer the bottle to the baby when it is starving -</strong>&nbsp if you are regularly breastfeeding the baby, offer the feeding bottle in between two feeding sessions. A hungry baby is more likely to be frustrated by a change in the method of feeding and is more likely to offer resistance even though it is hungry.</p>
                  <p><strong>Start with smaller quantities of bottle feed</strong>&nbsp and offer more often so that milk does not get wasted and the baby understands the routine.</p>
                  <p><strong>Use a slow-flow nipple and hold the bottle parallel</strong>&nbsp to the ground when feeding the baby. When the bottle is held in the parallel position, the baby has to work to pull milk from the bottle.</p>
                  <p><strong>Never force the nipple into the baby’s mouth.</strong>&nbsp Gently coax the baby to open the mouth wide by stroking the baby’s upper lip (to mimic breastfeeding).</p>
                  <p><strong>During the feed, take breaks to burp your baby</strong>&nbsp as babies tend to gulp in some amount of air while bottle feeding. The Air Ventilation System (AVS™) on PIGEON feeding bottle nipples has been designed taking this into consideration so that babies swallow less air and are able to suckle fully. The burp breaks will also give the baby time to recognize when (s)he is full. </p>
                  <p><strong>Check for Feeding cues -</strong>&nbsp If the baby gives you cues like turning his / her head away from the bottle or playing or acting disinterested, do not force him / her to finish the bottle as it probably means that the baby is full. </p>
                  <p><strong>Try asking someone else to offer the bottle -</strong>&nbsp babies tend to associate their mothers with breastfeeding so some moms have found success with bottle feeding when they step away and the father or caregiver offers the bottle instead.</p>
                  <ul>
                  <h6>Feeding Position</h6>
                  <p>Always hold your baby while feeding as it will help you to bond better and will also make it easier for you to learn / understand the baby’s feeding cues.</p>
                  <ul>
                  <p><strong>Use the cradling position while feeding -</strong>&nbsp In this bottle feeding position, the baby’s head rests in the crook of your arm as you hold his / her head and chest at a slight incline, close to your chest. This helps the milk to move smoothly into the baby’s stomach.</p>
                  <p><strong>Holding the baby in an almost seated position,</strong>&nbsp with the baby’s head and back resting on your chest or in the crook of your arm. This position is found to benefit babies who experience a lot of reflux. While in this position, ensure that you tilt the bottle so the milk completely fills the nipple and the baby does not gulp in air.</p>
                  <p><strong>Take the assistance of a pillow.</strong>&nbsp A nursing pillow can help to keep the baby’s chest and head propped up at an angle and take the weight off your arm and shoulder.</p>
                  <p><strong>Switch your baby from one arm to the other halfway through the bottle,</strong>&nbsp just as you would switch breasts. This helps mimic breastfeeding and will prevent the baby from developing a side preference. It will also naturally pace the feeding session and help the baby to decide whether (s)he is full.</p>
                  </ul>
                  <h6>Remember, It May Take Some Time!</h6>
                  <p>Despite all preparation, the baby may still refuse to take the bottle as quickly as you would like him / her to. It can be frustrating and worrying for the parents but rather than forcing the baby to feed (which is only going to upset both the baby and the parent), it is better to keep trying at regular intervals. With a little time, babies will ultimately learn to bottle feed comfortably and to their fill.</p>

  //         The breasts prepare for lactation after pregnancy.
  //         </p>
  //         <p>
  //         The breasts change and grow in size. The areola changes color and gets darker. Moreover, it gets more sensitive and larger as well.
  //         </p>
  //         <p>
  //         The reason behind this growth is acinus. Acinus grows in size in preparation for lactation after the baby is born and is located right at the tip of the breast duct.
  //         </p>
  //         <p>
  //         The breasts grow up to three to four times heavier than normal. Normal breasts weigh around 200g but after pregnancy, they can grow up to 600 to 800g.
  //         </p>
  //         <p>
  //         <The breasts start to get smaller after 6-9 months of the start of breastfeeding. It doesn’t, however, affect the ability to produce milk.

  //         <p>The mother’s breasts prepare for lactation after pregnancy</p>
  //         <h6>Hormones action during breastfeeding</h6>
  //         <p>Hormones called prolactin and oxytocin are produced when the baby sucks the nipple and the stimulation is transmitted to the pituitary gland. Prolactin is used to send the command of converting blood into breast milk and to push out the breast milk that accumulates in the breast ducts is the task of oxytocin.</p>
  //         <p>Because both baby and mother are still new to this process, breast milk might not be released at first, but both the mother and the baby will adapt to this process with repetition and practice.</p>
  //         <h6>Breast Milk secretion mechanism</h6>
  //         <p>A large number of acinar cells combine to make acinar.</p>
  //         <p>Breast Milk is secreted inside the acinar after being produced in acinar cells and is released through breast ducts. Myoepithelial cells work as a pump and contract to discharge the breast milk when the breastfeeding baby sucks the nipple.</p>

  //   description: `
  //   <h6>Breast milk contents change over time</h6>
  //   <p>There are numerous benefits of breastfeeding for babies and the breast milk contains numerous nutrients including lactose, protein, and fat and it has a number of advantages. As the baby grows, breast milk components change to adapt and meet the growing baby’s requirements. This is the reason why breastmilk is considered as the best food for the baby.</p>
  //   <h6>Components of breastmilk and their respective functions</h6>
  //   <p>
  //   All the main components of breastmilk namely lactose, fat, and protein have their specific characteristics.
  //   </p>
  //   <p>
  //   Lactose provides much-needed energy to the baby and is in the highest proportion of breastmilk.
  //   </p>
  //   <p>
  //   Fat is used in the maintenance of the baby’s body structure and is an important ingredient for brain development.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   Protein has necessary immunoproteins including lactoferrin and IGA. It also breaks down into amino acids and helps in muscle building.
  //   </p>
  //   <h6>Other components of breastmilk and their respective functions</h6>
  //   <h6 id="heading"><li>Reducing the risk of developing allergies</li></h6>
  //   <ul><li>Some substances in breastmilk help prevent allergies from invading the baby’s intestines by creating a protective coating on the intestinal walls. These substances also promote the development of the intestinal epidermis.</li></ul>
  //   <h6 id="heading"><li>Helping in easy digestion and absorption of breastmilk</li></h6>
  //   <ul><li>Babies have fragile intestinal systems and breast milk has enzymes, namely lipase, and amylase, which help in easy digestion and absorption.</li></ul>
  //   <h6>Changes in breast milk components over time</h6>
  //   <p>Breast Milk components change regularly. Sometimes after every nursing or even during nursing. This can be because of various reasons including the mother’s diet, the season, and the number of days postpartum. Here is a representation of how the breast milk components change according to the number of days postpartum and with each breastfeeding.<p>
  //   <h6>Components change in breastmilk in one breastfeeding</h6>
  //   <p>The breastmilk that is released each time a baby starts breastfeeding is called foremilk which is followed by hindmilk. As the baby continues to breastfeed the fat content in the milk, which is a source of energy for the baby, increases.</p>
  //   <img src=${featured10} alt="conditions" />
  //   <p>Conditions: Express breastmilk using a Pigeon Electric breast pump 5 times, 10 ml each. 5 ml of each sample was dispensed into test tubes, and centrifuged (3,000 rpm × 5 min.)</p>
  //   <h6>Change in breast milk components with respect to postpartum date</h6>
  //   <div>
  //   Colostrum and mature milk are two main groups of breastmilk.
  //   <br>
  //   The breast milk secreted until the fifth postpartum is called colostrum. It has a large content of immunoproteins, namely lactoferrin and IgA. It contains β-carotene and that is why it is yellowish.
  //   <br>
  //   10 days postpartum mature milk starts to secrete. This group contains lower quantities of proteins and a higher quantity of lactose and fat. This is why it is higher in calories and has a milky white color.</p>
  //   <img src=${featured8} />
  //   <h6>Postpartum date</h6>
  //   </div>
  //   <p>
  //   Time course of breast milk contents Indicated by relative values, contents of 3rd-5th postpartum date as 100%. Refferense:Itoda et al., 1991, Japanese Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Nutrition 5(1), P145-158.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   Human breast milk contains the highest content of lactose and the lowest content of protein relatively.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   Other animals such as Seals and whales that survive in harsher conditions under the surface of the ocean produce milk with higher fat content. Higher than other animals such as dogs, pigs, and humans having longer breastfeeding periods.

  //   description: `
  //   <h6>Hold the baby in an appropriate position so that you can breastfeed properly and comfortably</h6>
  //   <p>Usually, mothers have to breastfeed their babies for around 8-10 times a day and the duration for each feed is around 10-30 minutes. Mothers can get tired and stressful so it is important for them to feed their babies in a comfortable and relaxed position so that they can continue.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   It is important to hold the baby in an appropriate position for both the mother and the baby. It will help reduce risks and problems. Moreover, it will allow the baby to drink effectively and help reduce the stress on the mother’s breasts. Here are some specific breastfeeding newborn  tips.
  //   </p>
  //   <h6>How to hold your baby?</h6>
  //   <p>It is critical to position the baby properly while breastfeeding and to maintain appropriate posture. There are three ways you can position your baby for breastfeeding. The following items are important for all of them.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   The mother should be reclining against cushions or a wall and is in a relaxed position. The baby should be awake, not crying and he should be calm.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   The baby’s body should be straight and the ears, shoulders, and lower back should form a straight line and should be facing the breast.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   Make sure your fingers are far enough from the areola while supporting your breast with one hand. You don’t need to just squeeze the nipple to push it out. There won’t always be a need to support your breast with your hand.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   You will find a posture that is most appropriate and comfortable for you.
  //   </p>
  //   <h6>Basic positioning</h6>
  //   <h6 id="heading">1: Side hold/cradle hold</h6>
  //   <p>You will have to hold the baby at breast level and your baby’s stomach should be closer to yours. Support the baby’s head with your arm and while the baby’s head is on the same side as the breast you are nursing with. This is one of the common breastfeeding positions.</p>
  //   <img src=${featured11} alt="hold" />
  //   <br>
  //   <h6 id="heading">2: Cross cradle hold/transitional hold</h6>
  //   <p>
  //   This is the position in which you support the baby’s base of the neck using the opposite arm of the breast you are nursing with and supporting the breast with the other hand.
  //   <br>
  //   Sometimes, babies don’t enjoy it when you press hard on the baby’s head so this is a good position for this kind of baby. It is also the best position for the babies with lower birth weight and the babies who face difficulty latching on to the breast. Later, you can shift to the common cradle hold after the baby has latched on.
  //   </p>
  //   <img src=${featured12} alt="crossHold"/>
  //   <br>
  //   <h6 id="heading">3: Clutch hold/football hold</h6>
  //   <p>In this position, you support the breast with the hand opposite to the breast you are nursing with and support the head with the other hand. The baby ‘s legs will bass through the arm supporting him pointing backward. You need to hold the baby close to your side.
  //   <br>
  //   This position is best for babies having difficulty latching on and also for babies with sensitive health. It is also favorable for mothers having breast problems and also for mothers with cesarean scars because the baby won’t be pressing directly on the abdominal area.
  //   </p>
  //   <img src=${featured13} alt="clutchHold" />
  //   <br>
  //   <h6 id="heading">4: Straddle hold</h6>
  //   <p>
  //   This position involves you placing the baby on your knees while supporting the baby’s head and shoulders. It is particularly a better position for babies finding it difficult to latch on and for the babies who are smaller in size.
  //   </p>
  //   <img src=${featured14} alt="straddle hold"/>
  //   <p>
  //    Some of the mothers also do this while breastfeeding.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   Some mothers use rubber bands or hair clippers to keep their clothes back while breastfeeding so that the baby can easily feed without getting prevented by clothes.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   We are hopeful that both mothers and babies will be able to find better and comfortable breastfeeding positions.

  //   <h6>Help your baby in latching on to your nipple</h6>
  //   <p>
  //   Latching on means the baby attaching to the nipple or breast in order to breastfeed. It is important to make sure that the positioning is proper for the baby to be able to latch on easily and get enough milk.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   Firstly, have a look at the way a baby latches on to the mother’s breast and how the baby is breastfed.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   The baby’s mouth and tongue movement when he breastfeeds is different from an adult’s movement when he drinks. It is called peristaltic movement which is derived from sucking reflex movement.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   A new born baby has a specific round dent right in the centre of his upper jaw. This appears for a certain time to assist the baby in breastfeeding. The mother’s nipple is strongly held between the dent and the fat layer of the cheek. The fossa disappears as soon as the baby stops breastfeeding.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   Negative pressure is caused by the peristaltic movement which pulls the milk out of the nipple.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   The tongue movement is similar to a wave movement passing from the tip of the tongue towards the root in around 0.7 seconds.</p>
  //   <h6>The New-born Infant’s Sucking Reflex</h6>
  //   <p>
  //   This special muscle contraction in infants was first explained using an intraoral camera by Pigeon. This movement by infants was revealed in 1988 by professor Kazuko Eishima by filming inside the mouth using his intraoral camera while the babies were sucking.
  //   </p>
  //   <img src=${featured15} alt="latch" />
  //   <p>It is important to assist your baby in latching on properly to take full advantage of the peristaltic movement that is uniquely made for breastfeeding.</p>
  //   <img src=${featured16} alt="latchOne" />
  //   <p>Position the baby in a way that the baby’s nose faces the nipple and the lower jaw is touching the bottom part of the areola.</p>
  //   <img src=${featured17} alt="latchTwo" />
  //   <p>Touch the baby’s lips on the areola or the nipple to initiate the searching reflex in the baby. Wait for the baby to open the mouth and then move the baby close to the nipple.</p>
  //   <img src=${featured18} alt="latchThree"/>
  //   <p>First, the part that enters first in the baby’s mouth is the areola that is touching the baby’s lower jaw. Make sure the baby is latched on to the nipple firmly.</p>
  //   <img src=${featured19} alt="latchFour"/>
  //   <p>Most of the time, the baby will leave the nipple once he has had enough milk. However, if he doesn’t, slide your fingers softly around the side of the baby’s mouth to break the seal so that the baby can stop sucking.</p>

  //   description: `
  //   <h6>Take care of your diet for your baby’s sake.</h6>
  //   <p>
  //   Postpartum mothers require far more energy than during pregnancy. The reason is that they are producing breast milk and they require nutrition for that. Moreover, the mother is also taking care of the baby and getting far less sleep. That is why it is important to take care of the mother’s diet during this time.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   Most of the mothers neglect their own diet during this time but make sure that you take good care of your diet not just for you but for the baby’s sake.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   You have to give yourself at least six months to lose weight after pregnancy. Do not start excessive dieting right after childbirth as this will affect not only your health but also the health of the baby who you are breastfeeding.</p>
  //   <h6>Chance to increase the mother’s bone mass</h6>
  //   <p>Generally, women lose bone mass during pregnancy but they have a huge tendency to gain a lot of bone mass right after their period is restored. It is almost as if someone is building stronger bones inside their bodies.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   Make sure you supply nutrients needed by your body to build stronger bones after pregnancy. Calcium and vitamin D are building blocks for bones. Dairy products, eggs, and mushrooms are rich sources of vitamin D.</p>
  //   <h6>Bad effects of smoking and drinking</h6>
  //   <p>Too much drinking even after pregnancy will have bad effects including fetal alcohol syndrome, mental handicaps, as well as developmental disorders. You might want to try alcohol soon after giving birth but you should try to stay away from it for a bit longer. The reason is that almost 2% of alcohol will somehow find its way into breastmilk. Excessive smoking and drinking will even affect milk secretion. There can be a great effect of alcohol on the baby as compared to adults.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   It has been found that mothers who smoke generally produce less milk. Moreover, it has also been found that nicotine has direct negative effects on babies including diarrhoea, vomiting, and restlessness. It is an opportunity for the whole family to give up smoking.</p>
  //   <h6>The effects of caffeine</h6>
  //   <p>It has been found that when pregnant mothers have beverages having caffeine, the caffeine content is eventually excreted in the breast milk.</p>
  //   <ol>
  //   <li>Pregnant and breastfeeding mothers should stay away from caffeine because breastmilk that has caffeine can eventually cause sleeping disorders in babies.</li>

  //   <h6>Understand the signals 	that the baby is drinking breast milk</h6>
  //   <p>Some of the indicators of enough breast milk being produced are, the way the baby drinks breast milk, the frequency and even amount of stool and urine of the baby, and the body weight of the baby.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   Slight obstruction of the breast milk or even the baby’s crying is not the indicator of insufficient milk. It gradually stabilizes just as you continue to breastfeed the baby.
  //   </p>
  //   <img src=${featured20} alt="insuffientMilk"/>
  //   <h6>Baby’s Appearance and Its Causes.</h6>
  //   <p>There can be numerous other causes of the symptoms that are making you think that you are not producing enough breast milk.</p>
  //   <p>For example,</p>
  //   <ul><h6 id="heading"><li>Baby’s cries frequently, wakes up while sleeping, and starts crying</li></h6>
  //   <p>There can be reasons other than insufficient breast milk for a baby’s crying. The baby can be in a bad mood or is a light sleeper.</p>
  //   <h6 id="heading"><li>The baby wants to nurse more frequently than usual</li></h6>
  //   <p>The reason can be that the breast milk is light and is digested quite easily and quickly, it is a common occurrence that babies want to nurse more frequently.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   It also depends upon the baby’s growth. There will be periods when the baby grows more quickly and he will want more breast milk.
  //   </p>
  //   <h6 id="heading"><li>Your breasts don't get engorged</li></h6>
  //   <p>The breastfeeding mothers’ breasts might stop getting engorged after a few weeks of pregnancy. This doesn’t necessarily mean that you are not producing enough breast milk.</p>

  //   <h6 id="heading"><li>Your breasts are getting smaller</li></h6>
  //   <p>It has been found that breast size has nothing to do with the amount of breast milk.</p>

  //   <h6 id="heading"><li>Your baby takes in small amounts of breast milk</li></h6>
  //   <p>Different babies take in different amounts of breast milk. What you should be keeping in check is whether the baby is losing weight or gaining weight.</p>

  //   <h6 id="heading"><li>A little amount of breast milk is expressed</li></h6>
  //   <p>It has been found that the amount of breast milk secreted and the amount of milk baby drinks are different.</p>
  //   </ul>
  //   <h6>Actual signs that the baby is receiving enough breast milk</h6>
  //   <ul>
  //   <li>The baby breastfeeds more than 8 times per day.</li>
  //   <li>You can hear the baby gulping milk and the suckling motion slows down.</li>
  //   <li>The baby has healthy skin and good muscle tone.</li>
  //   <li>He shows no discontent between the feeding periods.</li>
  //   <li>He wets approximately six or more diapers a day with diluted and pale urine.</li>
  //   <li>The baby has around eight bowel movements per day. Older babies have less frequent stooling.</li>
  //   <li>The baby is gaining weight frequently with almost somewhere between 18-30a a day.</li>

  //   <p>There are mainly two types of breast milk insufficiency</p>
  //   <p>In case of lack of breast milk intake and hyposecretion of breast milk, refer to the following strategies for coping with the issue. Moreover, consult your doctor or an expert such as a midwife or a lactation consultant.</p>
  //   <h6 id="heading">1. Lack of breast milk intake</h6>
  //   <p>Insufficient breast milk intake because of the incorrect style of breastfeeding and the baby’s poor sucking.</p>
  //   <h6 id="heading">2. Counter Strategy</h6>
  //   <ul>
  //   <li>Find out how you position the baby while breastfeeding and modify it accordingly. Also, check how to assist your baby to latch on.</li>
  //   <li>Do not try and limit the duration and frequency of feeding, make sure the baby is nursing as much as he wants and as many times as he wants.</li>
  //   </ul>
  //   <h6 id="heading">3. Breast Milk Hyposecretion</h6>
  //   <ul>
  //   <li>It is the insufficiency of the production of breast milk.</li>
  //   </ul>
  //   <p>Insufficient breast milk intake can be a cause of hyposecretion It is divided into two types:</p>
  //   <p>Primary breast milk hyposecretion can be caused because of medical reasons including mammary gland hypoplasia. Secondary breast milk hyposecretion, however, happens when the breast milk production ability is there but is not supported in an appropriate manner, and in this situation, the amount of breast milk secreted may decrease or increase.</p>
  //   <h6 id="heading">4. Counter Strategy</h6>
  //   <p>If there are medical reasons behind breast milk hyposecretion, breast milk production will decrease and you need to take some supplements to tackle that.</p>
  //   <p>Sometimes, it so happens that one breast is producing insufficient milk. In this scenario, enough breast milk can still be taken from the other breast. breast milk secretion can also be affected by milk expression.</p>

  //   <p>The most common nipple problem that breastfeeding mothers face and that too during the early postpartum period is sore nipples.</p>
  //   <p>It has been found that this problem occurs because new mothers are not used to holding the baby appropriately to let the baby suck on the nipple. It can turn out to be a problem for continued breastfeeding. This section will highlight ways to prevent sore nipples and strategies that can be used to cope with them.</p>
  //   <h6>How can you prevent and cope with your symptoms?</h6>
  //   <h6>Symptoms</h6>
  //   <h6 id="heading">Nipple irritation</h6>
  //   <ul>
  //   <li>A cause for nipple sensitivity can be the fact that nipples aren’t used to external stimuli.</li>
  //   <li>Nipple soreness but to visible damage</li>
  //   <li>Internal bleeding can be a cause of pain, cracking, or blisters.</li>
  //   </ul>
  //   <img src=${featured10} alt=""/>
  //   <h6 id="heading">Reddened Skin</h6>
  //   <ul>
  //   <li>Thin surface skin of nipples</li>
  //   <li>Peeling off surface skin and visible inflammation of sub-epidermal layer.</li>
  //   </ul>
  //   <img src=${featured5} alt=""/>
  //   <h6 id="heading">Internal or external bleeding</h6>
  //   <p>The negative pressure because of the baby’s sucking causes anoxia in the papillary tissues because of edema or pooled blood in the nipple. This leads to capillary permeability causing burst capillaries and starting internal bleeding.</p>
  //  <img src=${featured6} alt=""/>
  //   <h6 id="heading">Crack</h6>
  //  <p>This gets created on the neck, sides, or the tip of the nipples. It hurts when the baby presses or sucks it and it somewhat resembles chapped skin.</p>
  //  <img src=${featured7} alt=""/>
  //  <h6 id="heading">Blisters</h6>
  //  <img src=${featured8} alt="" />
  //  <h6 id="heading">Leucoderma</h6>

  //  <h6 id="heading">Bite wound</h6>
  //  <ul>
  //  <li>A bite wound occurs when the baby bites the nipple during nursing.</li>
  //  <li>These are found in the neck of the nipples.</li>
  //  </ul>
  //  <h6>Causes</h6>
  //  <h6>Ephemeral sourness in the nipples during the early postpartum period</h6>
  //  <h6 id="heading">Why sort of nipple soreness?</h6>
  //  <ul>
  //  <li>During the early postpartum period, temporary pain occurs in the mother’s nipples even if the baby sucks in an appropriate way.</li>
  //  <li>The pain only lasts for about 20-30 seconds.</li>
  //  <li>The pain is at its peak around 3 to 6 days postpartum.</li>
  //  <li>The pain usually goes away as the mother’s breast milk secretion continues. </li>
  //  </ul>
  //  <h6 id="heading">Why?</h6>
  //  <ul>
  //  <li>Nipple sensitively is at its peak during the early days of postpartum</li>
  //  <li>The mechanism of breast milk secretion doesn’t function perfectly right from the start.</li>
  //  </ul>
  //  <h6>Inappropriate sucking motion by the nursing baby causes nipple sourness</h6>
  //  <h6 id="heading">Why?</h6>
  //  <ul>
  //  <li>The nipple is getting pressed by the baby during sucking</li>
  //  <li>The baby’s lips are pursed while sucking</li>
  //  <li>The baby’s tongue is pulled behind his gum while sucking </li>
  //  </ul>
  //  <h6>When the mother’s breast is removed forcefully from the baby’s mouth, it causes nipple soreness</h6>

  //  </ul>
  //  <h6 id="heading">Why?</h6>
  //  <p>
  //  Candida can occur at any point in time.
  //  <br>
  //  The reason for this can be that the baby has oral candida infection, diaper rash, or even if the mother has colpitis.

  //  <h6>Swelling and lumps</h6>
  //  <p>
  //  Use appropriate positioning and increase the frequency of breastfeeding if you find swelling or lumps. Moreover, express breast milk between and after feeding to take care of lumps or swelling. Expressing the breast also helps with burning because of lumps. If left untreated, lumps have the potential to become mastitis in the mammary gland. A big warning of mastitis is the baby not wanting breast milk anymore.

  //  <h6>Mastitis</h6>
  //  <p>
  //  Mastitis is a breast disease that causes fever, pain chills, flu, and engorgement in addition to other systematic symptoms.</p>
  //  <p>
  //  Mastitis can happen anytime during the breastfeeding period but it is most common 2 to 3 weeks postpartum.
  //  </p>
  //  <p>There are two primary types of mastitis, one is with bacterial infection and the other is without it.</p>
  //  <h6 id="heading">1. Congestive mastitis</h6>
  //  <p>This type of mastitis doesn’t cause bacterial infection but brings breast inflammation. It also causes engorgement, lumps, redness, burning in breasts, and also fever. You should make sure to position appropriately while breastfeeding if you have these symptoms and try to cope with the breast milk disruption.</p>
  //  <h6 id="heading">2. Acute purulent mastitis</h6>
  //  <p>The symptoms like fever, flu, chills and body pain, etc. don’t improve even 24 hours after the start, there is a possibility that you are infected by the bacterial form of mastitis. In case of severe symptoms, you should consult a specialist and you may have to go through a course of antibiotics.</p>

  //   <h6>Different babies have different growth rates</h6>
  //   <p>
  //   You might notice that your baby is not gaining weight and wonder if he is drinking breast milk appropriately or not. You might even think that breast milk alone isn’t enough.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   The fact is that different babies grow at different rates. Some babies grow at a slower pace and some of them might grow slowly regardless of the amount of breast milk they have. There is no need to worry about it.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   It has also been found that newborn babies lose almost 10% of body weight during the first few days after birth.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   The reason behind this weight loss is that babies get rid of excess fluids which they retain during their time inside the uterus.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   It takes about 2 to 3 weeks for babies to get back to normal weight provided that the breastfeeding goes smooth.</p>
  //   <h6>Determining is the baby is growing adequately</h6>
  //   <p>
  //   There are ways to check if your baby is gaining weight apart from noticing the amount of breast milk he drinks, these include monitoring the baby’s energy, how much urine he passes, the way your baby drinks breast milk, the rhythm in breastfeeding. In addition to these, it is important to understand how to determine the amount of breast milk the baby is getting.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   Signs such as the baby not being energetic enough, the baby not drinking milk frequently, diapers not getting wet often, less frequent bowel movements, strange breastfeeding rhythm, and longer breastfeeding sessions, are not good signs so if you notice any of these, consult a doctor or a midwife.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   If your baby doesn’t gain weight frequently and steadily, the reason can be that the baby isn’t having enough breast milk. You should consult a doctor in this case and not try to judge by yourself.
  //   </p>
  //   <h6>Signs of a baby having enough breast milk</h6>
  //   <ul>
  //   <li>The baby is breastfeeding around eight times a day.</li>
  //   <li>His rhythm will slow down as the milk is released and you can hear a gulping and swallowing sound.</li>

  //   <li>The baby stays content between breastfeeding cycles.</li>
  //   <li>The baby wets about six to eight diapers in a day, the urine should be pale and diluted.</li>
  //   <li>Bowel movements should stay consistent at least three times per day. Stooling will not be as frequent as the baby grows.</li>

  //   <p>
  //   Some breast engorgement or baby’s crying is not the indicator of insufficient breast milk being produced.</p>

  //   <h6>Reasons why the babies bite nipples.</h6>
  //   <img src=${featured6} alt="babied bite nipples" />
  //   <ul>
  //   <li>The baby sometimes bites the mother’s nipple when he gets used to breastfeeding.</li>
  //   <li>Do not worry if this happens. There is nothing to worry about and don’t think that you are not producing sufficient milk or about the milk’s taste. This is a part of exploratory sucking which starts approximately three months after the birth. This means that even if the baby is hungry, he will focus more on playing with the nipple, rolling his tongue and lips rather than focusing more on feeding. This is particularly
  //   the point when lips and tongue start to move in different ways and the baby is exploring this aspect.</li>
  //   <li>Another reason is that the baby’s gums feel itchy because his teeth are growing. The baby cuts his first tooth 7-8 months after the baby’s birth.</li>
  //   <li>This might hurt and it will be a bit tough for you but don’t scold your baby and treat him well.</li>
  //   <li>When the baby bites the nipple and it gets cut, breastfeeding will get tougher for you because it will hurt. Take good care of the nipple following all the guidelines.</li>

  //   <h6>Why not help your wife with household chores and baby care?</h6>
  //   <p>
  //   Babies are overloaded with cuteness and all you want to do is keep looking at your baby. You’ll think ‘’I’m a father!’’ much more than before delivery.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   However, you’ll be engulfed by uncertainty about raising a baby and taking care of him. The mother has learned quite a lot during the pregnancy about baby care but it might not be the same for you understandably. There are still things you can do to help her out and take care of the baby as a father. Just do your best and enjoy caring for your baby along with your wife.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   Remember, if it is your first baby then the mother will also be as uncertain. She is going to have to feed the baby as well as change the diapers. This will exhaust her as she also won’t be getting enough sleep. You yourself will definitely be busy but it is a good idea to try and help her out with the baby as well as housework.
  //   </p>
  //   <h6>How can a father help the mother?</h6>
  //   <h6 id="heading">1. Helping with household chores and child-rearing</h6>
  //   <p>The mother will be performing numerous tasks right after the baby is born including feeding the baby, changing diapers, and bathing as well. You can help her out by performing laundry and cleaning. Even some nighttime feeding and cleaning would help the mother a lot and allow her to rest a bit. Even if you are not able to help. Simply asking her if she needs help with anything would lighten her burden a bit.</p>
  //   <h6 id="heading">2. Frequently communicating with your wife</h6>
  //   <p>Your wife is not used to taking care of the baby and she has to do it all day every day. This might tire her and even irritate her a bit. She must have a lot to tell you about the baby because the baby’s expressions are changing on a daily basis. You might not be able to stay home the whole day because of your job but you need to reassure her that your heart is with her and ask her about the day. Share your feeling as well as listen to hers and ask about the baby’s development. Remember, you two will be partners in raising the child.</p>
  //   <h6 id="heading">3. Enjoy watching your baby grow up, together</h6>
  //   <p>Your baby will grow up in front of your eyes. He’ll learn newer reflexes every day. He’ll start holding his head up and his arms/legs will grow as well as ever-changing facial expressions. The baby will also learn to communicate how he is feeling using facial expressions and sounds and even some words. In the first few years, the baby will grow and change with each passing day. It is the time to connect with your baby and both of you need to enjoy this fascinating time.</p>

  //   <h6>Understanding baby’s primitive reflexes</h6>
  //   <p>Primitive reflexes are involuntary movements by babies. Babies are born with these reflexes and they disappear gradually as the baby grows. Different babies stop these at different stages.</p>
  //   <h6 id="heading">1. Rooting reflex</h6>
  //   <p>
  //   Rooting reflex is the baby’s reflex to close her lips as soon as something touches her mouth. Moreover, the baby will suck your finger if you put it in her mouth. This is called the sucking reflex. All the babies are born with these and these stay until the baby is around 4-5 months old.</p>
  //   <p>
  //   Try it by touching your baby’s lips
  //   </p>
  //   <h6 id="heading">2. Exploratory reflex</h6>
  //   <p>
  //   When you touch your baby’s cheek, she will turn her head in the direction of the stimulus. This is called the exploratory reflex.</p>

  //   Try it by touching your baby’s cheeks.
  //   </p>
  //   <h6 id="heading">3. Palmar grasp reflex</h6>
  //   <p>
  //   The baby will grab your finger if you put it on her palm. This is called the Palmar grasp reflex and it lasts until the baby is six months old.</p>

  //   <h6 id="heading">How to treat?</h6>
  //   <ul>
  //   <li>Carefully nurse the baby in the initial stages and sucking, swallowing and breathing movements will get coordinated by around 35 weeks.</li>
  //   <li>Use kangaroo care and try to get babies practice latching on to the breasts on their own.</li>
  //   <li>Massage the insides and outside of the baby’s mouth to make them used to the swallowing and sucking stimulus.</li>
  //   <li>Exercise the baby's oral cavity to generate negative pressure by gently pressing both cheeks.</li>
  //   </ul>
  //   <h6 id="heading">2) Babies with a cleft palate/cleft lip. Sucking and swallowing: Symptoms summary</h6>
  //   <ul>
  //   <li>Dysfunction of generating negative pressure as well as compressing nipple in the oral cavity create sucking difficulties.</li>

  //   <li>Aerophagia risk</li>
  //   <li>Excessive sucking time with less milk intake.</li>
  //   </ul>
  //   <h6 id="heading">How to treat:</h6>
  //   <ul>
  //   <li>Breastfeed with care keeping in check the backward flow of milk.</li>
  //   <li>Maintain appropriate position during breastfeeding</li>
  //   <li>Make sure of shielding lips while sucking for babies with cleft lips.</li>
  //   <li>Use an artificial palate such as Hotz-type Orthopedic Plate for babies with cleft palate.</li>

  //   <h6 id="heading">3) Swallowing and sucking for babies having micrognathia: Symptoms summary</h6>
  //   <ul>
  //   <li>Babies having smaller jaws, receding mandible depressed roots of the tongue will sometimes have blocked respiratory path and eventually cause swallowing and sucking disorders.</li>
  //   <li>Receding mandible, cleft palate, obstruction of airways, and depression of the root of the tongue, can be characterized as robin sequence. Airway obstruction can cause difficulty in generating negative pressure eventually making it difficult for the baby to suck.  </li>
  //   <li>Babies with Robin sequence generally have a U-shaped cleft palate and as a consequence, the backward flow of milk, more often than not, enters the nasal cavity.</li>
  //   </ul>
  //   <h6 id="heading">How to treat?</h6>
  //   <ul>
  //   <li>It is important to check whether the airway is blocked or not because the babies who have micrognathia have respiratory disorders.</li>
  //   <li>It is advised to hold the babies vertically or pronely for effective nursing making sure that the airway isn’t blocked or the baby’s tongue isn’t receding.</li>
  //   <li>If the baby is having both micrognathia and cleft palate, it is advised to take care of the cleft palate itself.</li>
