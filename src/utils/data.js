    It is said that breast milk is the best gift that you can give your newborn babies. It is nutrients rich and easily digestible. The Baby’s sucking motion releases the hormones including prolactin and oxytocin to produce milk and the baby’s peristaltic tongue movements ensure smooth milk flow. It is more than just a feeding exercise but a bonding period for the mother and the baby also termed as a baby-mother time!

    Residual milk tends to dry up and stick to the walls of the feeding bottles and other feeding equipment. Unless the equipment is thoroughly cleaned and sterilized after use, there is a high risk of infections in the baby. PIGEON Liquid Cleanser cleans effectively removing stains and built-up residue to provide completely clean baby bottles. It is made of 100% food-grade ingredients to ensure maximum safety to babies, even with cleanser residue, and is great to clean after each use.  PIGEON baby bottle cleaner brushes are designed to clean hard-to-reach pockets of the feeding equipment with an easy grip. 
    <br>
    Feeding equipment that is in use regularly needs to be sterilized after use at least once daily. Sterilizing bottles and feeding equipment removes the harmful germs that can affect the still-developing immune system of babies. Pigeon electric steam sterilizers come in three types. The Pigeon Compact Steam Sterilizers are portable and slim. Pigeon Rapid Steam Sterilizers which quickly complete the cleaning, and Multi-Function Sterilizers which work as sterilizers, baby food warmers as well as baby milk bottle warmers.

    Keep your baby’s feeding equipment clean and germ-free with PIGEON’s range of cleansing and sterilizing accessories.`,

    Having understood the need to breastfeed the baby, it should also be taken into consideration that life gets quite busy and challenging. Not all mothers can feed their babies for longer periods because of work commitments as well as medical issues. 
    <br>
    Pigeon, having years of experience in infant breastfeeding, proudly introduces a dynamic range of breastfeeding pumps developed by experts having vast knowledge about breastfeeding. After years of thorough research, Pigeon identifies the three vital aspects of breast milk expression – Fit, Gentle Stimulation, and Expression. It allows mothers to express milk in a natural way and with ease.`,

    yourBabyText: `Because the baby is sleeping the whole night, you can easily set a daily routine and you can take him out with you providing a favorable environment. Babies start to hold things in their hand by this time so your baby is going to put things in his mouth, it is important to keep dangerous things out of the baby’s reach.`,

    The development of the amniotic sac, which forms a protective shell over the fertilized egg,
    induces a number of sudden changes in the body during this trimester so you will experience
    excessive symptoms of nausea and vomiting if you are suffering from morning sickness.
    <br>
    You will also notice unpleasant sensations, swollen nipples, and darkening of nipples as well.
    Constipation, heartburn, and indigestion are also common symptoms for some women, as is an
    intensified need to urinate. During the first trimester, there isn’t much weight gain.

    For the majority of pregnant women, this is the most rewarding phase of their pregnancy. Your
    baby bump will begin to appear in your shirt, your first trimester morning sickness will begin to
    disappear, and your energy levels will begin to rise. When your uterus expands during birth, it
    places pressure on the muscles and ligaments in your lower abdomen, creating slight cramps.
    <br>
    Your facial skin can grow dark patches as a result of hormonal changes, and a dark line known
    as linea nigra may occur on your abdomen. Stretch marks may appear on the belly, legs,
    buttocks, and breasts as the skin and muscles stretch. It is important to maintain your oral
    hygiene while pregnant, as you may experience swollen and bleeding gums, as well as cavities
    due to tooth enamel loss.

    The final weeks of your pregnancy are known as the third trimester. Your uterus stretches as your baby rises, changes, and begins to shift positions. Backaches, urinary incontinence, swelling knees, varicose veins, and hemorrhoids, as well as shortness of breath, can be more common, particularly when you lie down.
    <br>
    Your breasts may swell, and colostrum, the same fluid that will nourish your baby in the first few days of birth, will be discharged. In the final trimester of birth, you'll probably feel clumsier and more exhausted. During this trimester, you may feel sciatica, or shooting nerve pain that runs from your lower back to your buttocks and down your thigh.
    <br>
    Braxton Hicks contractions, also known as "fake labor," trigger stomach cramps, but this is just the body planning for birth and does not indicate that you are in labor. Light bleeding in the second trimester, on the other hand, might indicate that you're about to give birth.
